#threeflow.js : sunflow for three.js

###version <%= @version %> - beta

###Overview

Threeflow.js lets you render three.js scenes with the sunflow renderer.  If you don't know what sunflow is - it's a 3D ray tracer that renders photo-realistic images - visit here for more information.

Threeflow.js is in beta, but gives support of rendering standard three.js Meshes using Geometry or BufferGeometry/Geometry2.  Materials in three.js will be mapped to default materials in sunflow or you can ( or should for now ) use the threeflow materials directly.

###Installation

Make sure you have java and npm installed; then run the npm install command with the -g option:
```shell
npm install -g threeflow
```

Threeflow needs to render images and scene files into a folder on your hard drive. It also needs a static folder to deliver via its local http server. Threeflow can set this up for you with the init command.

Create a new folder, and from inside that folder run:
```shell
threeflow init
```
This should setup a project folder, copying examples and creating render folders. See below for more info on project structure.

To start the server and start rendering run:
```shell
threeflow start
```
Then in the browser connect to: http://localhost:3710
